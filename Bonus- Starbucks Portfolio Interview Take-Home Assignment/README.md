## Description

### About the Data
- The Dataset Provided is originally used as a take-home assignment provided by Starbucks for their job candidates. 
- Test an advertising promotion to see if it would bring more customers to purchase a specific product priced at $10. (Each promotion costs the company 0.15 to send out.)
- It consists of about 120,000 data points split in a 2:1 ratio among training and test files.
- Each data point includes one column indicating if the individual purchased that product. Aditionally, each individual has 7 additional features provided abstractly as V1-V7
### Objective
- Use the training data to understand what patterns in V1-V7 indicate that a promotion should be provided to a user.
- Try to limit the promotion only to those that are most receptive to it.
### Maximize the following Metrics
####  Incremental Response Rate (IRR)
Shows how many more customers purchased the product with the promotion, as compared to if they didn't receive the promotion.

Where:
1. treat --> treatment group - group that received the promotion
2. ctrl --> control group - non-promotional group
3. purch --> number of purchasers 
4. cust --> number of customers

#### Net Incremental Revenue (NIR)
Shows how much is made (or lost) by sending out the promotion.
