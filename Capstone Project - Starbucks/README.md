## Project Overview: <a name="overview"></a>

This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.

Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set. This project will try to optimize the decision of choosing users to receive offers.

## Problem Statements and Strategy: <a name="problem"></a>

This project will solve the problem of predicting if the user is most likely to buy after seeing an ad. This will be tackled by creating embedding for the users and generating recommendations of the top N (i.e. top 10) similar users and then predicting from these top users if the main user is more likely to buy after getting a promotion offer.
